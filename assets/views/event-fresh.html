      <h4>Suits</h4>
      <p>This event focuses on finding your own voice through the crowd.<br><b>ROUND 1:<br></b>
      	<p style="text-indent:50px;">A team of two would be going up for this quiz. Each team would be handed out with a list of clues regarding the places where they would have to go and clear the quiz. A small quiz of around 5 questions would be given to each team at every location.
The questions asked would be regarding the previous location they visited. The first 10 teams to clear their respective quiz and arrive at the final destination would be qualified.
</p>

<b><p>ROUND 2:</p></b><p style="text-indent:50px;">A picture would be shown to all the 10 teams simultaneously and 5 min duration would be allotted. During this 5 min each team has to prepare a story board inspired from the picture which was shown before. After the allotted 5 min are over, the team members would be separated from each other. One team member would have to write down the story limiting themselves to a maximum of 150 words in 5 min. Then later the other team member would have to narrate and explain the team’s perception regarding the picture to a panel of jury. The best performing 4 teams would be allowed to advance to the final round.
</p>

<b><p>ROUND 3:</p></b><p style="text-indent:50px;">The surviving 4 teams would be dismembered and would be sent to a panel of jury who would be judging each one individually on their viewpoints, personality, confidence and knowledge. A special twist is awaiting for the finalists that would be revealed on the spot.</p>
